# so for the second half lets think of it as is react enough to create a fast prodn ready app can react itself do it NO
<!-- there are a lot of code other packages we need to get our app fast -->
let introduce to npm so it is everything but not node package manager doesnt stand for it (:)   so it manages packages but not spans node package manager behind the scenes it works at it , it is standard repository for all the packages everything is hoisted in it when we create create react app it automatically has npm app
<!-- this is basically a configuration for npm -->
why do we need it so basically it takes care of dependancy meaning packages along with version control so teh first one is gonna be bundler our whole code needs to be compressed or cleaned before it is send to production so web pack parsel weet these 3 things are bundlers bundler basically bundles the app so it can ship the app 
so which one we using parcel just a choice and easy to configure it is the best library and will give strength to our app
there are 2 types of dependancies packages in our app one is web other is normal 
web one is required in developing phase 
normal are used in production also that is the difference and -D tells as dev dependancy
# parcel is a beast making u amazed
